# We_Square?

**We_Square?** is named after the colloquialism, “Are we square?” which we ask each other to determine whether we or not we owe each other money for shared expenses.

**We_Square?** is an expense tracking application with full data persistence in which users can have multiple ledgers with different people, record shared expenses on their ledgers, identify who paid for what items, and view a summary of how to balance out their shared expenses evenly.

It is developed using Python and a model-view-control architecture.
