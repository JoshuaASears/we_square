# we_square?

We_Square? is named after the colloquialism, “Are we square?” which we ask each other to determine whether we owe someone money or not. 

We Square is an expense tracking application with full data persistence in which users can record shared expenses on a ledger, identify who paid for what items, and then get a summary of who owes who how much to balance out the expenses.

It is developed using Python 3.11, the Tkinter GUI API, and a model-view-control architecture.

## Current version: Pre-release v 0.1.0

UI only! Back end is currently under development.
